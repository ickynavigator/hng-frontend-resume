        Iâ€™m an IT student in my third year, studying Information & Technology,
        at Eastern Mediterranean University in Northern Cyprus.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about Web development and currently I am learning
        TypeScript (a superset of JS). I like to practice my skills on sites
        like Code wars, CSS battle and Try Hack Me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently seeking internship opportunities to help me harness and
        develop my skills in these areas.
